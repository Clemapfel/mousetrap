# Chapter 6: Image & Sound

In this chapter we will learn:
+ How to represent colors in mousetrap
+ How to load, store, modify and display 2d images
+ How to load, store and play audio, both from memory and from the disk

## Introduction

Mousetrap was originally part of a never-released app for frame-by-frame animation. With the seizing of development for 
that app, I decided to plug out its GUI engine, polish it and its documentation, port it to Julia and make it 
available publicly as mousetrap.

I note this back-story here because a lot of the mousetrap library was specifically designed for this purpose, mousetrap has robust image-processing features . Images can effortly be exchanged with both GTK4 and OpenGL component, making editing and displaying
images easy and - thanks to hardware accelleration - fast. 

Mousetraps origin makes it suited for apps about illustration, animation, and scientific image processing.
